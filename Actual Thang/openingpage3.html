      <p id = "text">The 7th UN Sustainable development goal is Affordable and Clean Energy. Between 1990 and 2010, the number of people with access to electricity has increased by 1.7 billion. There are still 860 million people without access to electricity and over 2.6 billion people do not have access to clean cooking facilities. Many people without access to electricity and clean cooking will eventualy receive access and the number of people without electricity and clean cooking will decrease. With such an influx of new people, what does this mean for the environment, how we use energy and what we use for evergy?</p>

      <p id = "text"> 
      The demand for energy is going to rise dramatically and the only way to sustain this influx of people will be to create clean and affordable energy so that it is available to all. If we do not do this, we will not have enough energy to spread amongst all of the new people and people will once again be left without electricity. As well, the environmental impacts will be severe as the energy pollution that would take place could be catastrophic. It is necessary to create clean and affordable energy, so that we can provide energy to each other while protecting our planet.</p>
