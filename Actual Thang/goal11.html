</p>

      <p id = "text">The 11th UN Sustainable development goal is Sustaiable Cities and Communities. Although the number of people who live in slums has heavily decreased, there still remain more than 1 billion people who live in such conditions. Access to transportation and open public spaces has been decreasing, and the population has been increasing at a rate the cities are not going to be able to handle. Cities <i>must</i> change to become more sustainable in order to handle the population growth.</p>

      <p id = "text"> 
      Some of the goals within goal 11 are ensure access for all to adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic services and upgrade slums and enhance inclusive and sustainable urbanization and capacity for participatory, integrated and sustainable human settlement planning and management in all countries. Only if goals like these met will we have a chance to not only imrpove our standard of life, but everybody else's as well and prepare for the population increase that is yet to come.</p>
